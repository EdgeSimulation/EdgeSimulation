CloudSim Log directory

# Log directory
To be able to run CloudSim simulations using the provided .jar file you need to have created a ```/log``` directory in the same location with the ```.jar``` file (as in the repo).

In this log directory you will:
* place the initial positioning and migration files obtained with the jypiter notebook 
* find the output from CloudSim once you run the simulation(s)
