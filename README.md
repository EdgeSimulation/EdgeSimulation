E2E simulation workflow

# Simulation workflow


## STEP 1 - Run OMNET

how to run OMNET

## STEP 2 - Process OMNET log file

The OMNET log file which is the output of the OMNET simulation is used as input for the ```JupyterNotebooks/MobileHandover_and_Delay``` jupyter notebook that analyses the delay and handover information and generates consolidated delay ```.csv``` output and initial placement and migration ```.txt``` files needed for CloudSim.

Note: you may need to adjust the location of the log files relative to the jupyter notebook.

## STEP 3 - Run CloudSim

The initial placement and migration txt files obtained from the jupyter notebook should be placed in a ```/log``` folder located together with the ```CloudSim/1s_CloudSimSUMORun.jar```

The CloudSim simulation can be started using the following notation:
```java -jar 1s_CloudSimSUMORun.jar HOSTS TYPE PLACEMENT MIGRATION SERVICES initialPositioning.txt migrations.txt```

See the README.md file in /CloudSim for details on each of the parameters.

Note that sometimes the CloudSim scheduler may complain about concurrent events problems due to the way it is originally implemented in the simulator. This can be avoided by changing the start time of the problematic service to start a bit earlier.

## STEP 4 - Process CloudSim log file

CloudSim log files need to be post processed to obtain the necessary inforation for computing the services delays at the edge and cloud network. They are the input of the ```JupyterNotebooks/cloudsim_postprocess``` jupyter notebook that generates a set of files that are the input of the ```JupyterNotebooks/cloudsim_postpro_R``` notebook that computes the infrastructure network delay in an output file. The rest of the files obtained by the first notebook can be used for the generation of other figures showing more detailed resource management performance results.

Note: you may need to adjust the location of the log files relative to both jupyter notebooks

## STEP 5 - Process e2e delay

Use PostProcess_E2Edelay that will read the .csv output from step 1 and the [CHANGE .csv output file of step 4] log file output from CloudSim and calculate the end to end delay from service to user. Two output files will be created:
* a detailed information about e2e delay
* binned e2e delay that is averaged over a given period of time 

## STEP 6 - Visualise results


First simulation results can be obtained with the ```JupyterNotebooks/e2eDelay_plots``` jupyter notebook that generates several types of figures in per simulation and also with aggregated data of several simulations. Input data to this notebook are the e2e delay files generated by STEP 5.

Binned e2e delay boxplot figures  are created with the```JupyterNotebooks/e2eDelay_bins_plot``` jupyter notebook.
